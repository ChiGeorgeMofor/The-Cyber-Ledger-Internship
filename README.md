# The Cyber Ledger - Cybersecurity Internship Journey

![The Cyber Ledger Banner](https://thecyberledger.in/assets/TheCyberLedgerLogo.png)

This repository serves as a living document of my 12-week journey as a Cybersecurity Intern at **The Cyber Ledger**. It contains my personal notes, lab work, and project code, structured by the core competencies and skills I developed throughout the program. The goal is to translate theoretical knowledge into practical, demonstrable skills.

## 🚀 Core Competencies & Skills Gained

This section outlines the primary domains I explored, moving beyond a weekly schedule to focus on the capabilities I've acquired.

### 🛡️ Foundational Security & OS Internals
- **Security Mindset:** Adopted and applied both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) perspectives to analyze systems.
- **Operating System Hardening:** Gained proficiency in securing Linux and Windows environments by understanding their core internals, permissions, and common misconfigurations.

### 🌐 Network & Enterprise Security
- **Network Fundamentals:** Mastered core networking concepts, traffic analysis (using tools like Wireshark), and the identification of malicious patterns.
- **Active Directory (AD) Security:** Learned to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities within Active Directory environments, a critical skill for enterprise penetration testing.
- **GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance):** Developed an understanding of how security policies and compliance frameworks shape an organization's security posture.

### 💻 Modern Application Security (DevSecOps)
- **Web Application Penetration Testing:** Performed hands-on exploits of critical vulnerabilities outlined in the OWASP Top 10, including SQL Injection, Broken Access Control, and Security Misconfiguration.
- **API Security:** Analyzed and secured API endpoints, understanding common flaws like insecure deserialization and improper access control.
- **DevOps Security:** Explored methods for integrating security practices into the CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps).

### ⚔️ Offensive Security & Incident Response
- **Privilege Escalation & Post-Exploitation:** Practiced techniques for escalating privileges on compromised systems (Windows & Linux) and performing lateral movement.
- **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR):** Gained foundational skills in evidence collection, analysis, and the procedures for responding to a security incident.

### 🔮 Emerging Threats & Specialized Systems
- **AI/ML Security:** Investigated the unique attack vectors and security considerations for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models.
- **IoT & SCADA/OT Security:** Analyzed the vulnerabilities specific to Internet of Things (IoT) devices and industrial control systems (SCADA/Operational Technology).
